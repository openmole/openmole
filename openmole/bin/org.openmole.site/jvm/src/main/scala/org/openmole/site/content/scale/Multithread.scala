By default OpenMOLE tasks run on a single thread of your local machine.
To use several cores of your computer, you can define a so called ${code{"LocalEnvironment"}} with the number of threads to use as a parameter, see below:

$br$br

${hl.openmole("""
// Use 10 threads / cores
val env = LocalEnvironment(10)
""")}

""")
