Typed signatures of OpenMOLE methods.



@h2{Single criterion Calibration}

The single criterion calibration of a model can be seen as a general function, whose signature can be typed, and be noted as:

@br@br

@div(style:="text-align:center")
    Calibration@sub{single} :  (X → Y) → Y → X

@br

With X the input space, and Y the output space.

@br@br

In other words, this function takes a model M whose signature is (X→Y) (since it transforms inputs into outputs), an element @i{y} of Y representing the criterion value to reach, and finds an element @i{x} of X such that M(@i{x}) is the "closest" possible value to @i{y}.



@h2{Multi criteria Calibration}

The signature function of multi-criteria calibration can be typed as:

@br@br

@div(style:="text-align:center")
    Calibration@sub{multi} : (X → Y) → Y → [X]

@br

With X the input space, and Y the output space.

@br@br

In other words, this function takes a model M whose signature is (X→Y), an element @i{y} of Y representing the list of criteria values to reach, and finds a list @i{x} of elements of X such that M(@i{x}) is Pareto dominant compared to every image of other elements of X by M, regarding criterion @i{y}.



@h2{Profile}

The profile method can be typed likewise:

@br@br

@div(style:="text-align:center")
    Profile:   (𝓧@sub{1},...,𝓧@sub{k},) → {1,...,k} → [(𝓧,Y)]
@div(style:="text-align:center")
    such that: Profile(M)(i) = [(𝒙@sub{i1},y@sub{1}), ... , (𝒙@sub{in}, y@sub{n})],
@div(style:="text-align:center")
                ∀ j ∈ [1;n], y@sub{j} = min@sub{𝒙∈X@sub{@RawFrag{-i}}}@RawFrag{(M(𝒙))}
@div(style:="text-align:center")
                X@sub{@RawFrag{-i}} = {𝒙∈𝓧@sub{1} x ... x 𝓧@sub{i-1} x {𝒙@sub{i}} x 𝓧@sub{i+1} x ... x 𝓧@sub{k}}

@br

With M, the model, X, the input space, Y, the output space, 𝓟(X) the power set of X (@i{i.e.} every subset of X, including X and ∅).

@br

In other words: this function takes a model M (whose signature is (X→Y)), an element @i{y} of Y (y is the list of criterion value to reach) and find a list of elements of X (noted @i{x}) such that M(x) are Pareto dominant compared to every image of other elements of X by M, regarding criterion @i{y}.



@h2{PSE}

The PSE method can be typed as:

@br@br

@div(style:="text-align:center")
    PSE :   (X → Y) → 𝓟(X)
    @br
    such that : PSE(M) = M(X)

@br

With M, the model ; X, the input space ; Y, the output space ; and 𝓟(X) the power set of X (@i{i.e.} every subset of X, including X and ∅).

@br

In other words, this function takes a model M whose signature is (X→Y), an element @i{y} of Y representing the list of criterion values to reach, and finds a list @i{x} of elements of X such that M(@i{x}) are Pareto dominant compared to every image of other elements of X by M, regarding criterion @i{y}.
