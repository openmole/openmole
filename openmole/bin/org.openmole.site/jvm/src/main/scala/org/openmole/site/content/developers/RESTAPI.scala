${h2{"REST API"}}

Warning: The REST API of OpenMOLE is still experimental, it might be subject to some backward incompatible changes in the future.

$br

OpenMOLE ships with a web server providing a REST API to ${b{"start"}} workflows, ${b{"manage"}} their execution, and ${b{"retrieve"}} their output data.
To start the OpenMOLE REST API, run the command ${code{"openmole --rest --port 8080"}} from the console.
If you need to launch it automatically in a deamon for instance, you should also give the --password-file argument to provide the password for encryption of the preferences.

$br

The web server can be accessed at the URL ${i{"http://localhost:8080"}}.
Replace ${i{"localhost"}} with the remote machine's hostname or IP address if the web server is not running on your local system.


${h2{"API Reference"}}

The API exposes the following routes to submit and manage executions:
${ul(
   li{html"""
     ${b{"POST /job"}} - start a mole execution. It has the following parameters:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"workDirectory"}} - a tar.gz archive containing the workDirectory for the script"},
        li{html"${b{"script"}} - the path (relative to the workDirectory) of the script to execute, the last line should be a puzzle"}
      )}
      When successful, it returns a structure containing:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the execution"}
      )}
      When something has failed, it returns a structure containing:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"message"}} - the error message}"},
        li{html"${b{"stackTrace"}} - optionally a stack trace if the error has been caused by an exception"}
      )}
    """},
    li{html"""
      ${b{"GET /job/:id/state"}} - return the state of a mole execution. It has the following parameters:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the mole execution"}
      )}
      When successful, it returns a structure representing the state:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"state"}} - the state of the execution, it can be running, finished or failed"}
      )}
      When running, the other fields are:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"ready, running, completed"}} - the number of jobs in each of these states in the execution"},
        li{html"${b{"environments"}} - that contains the state for each execution environment on the execution. This is a JSON structure containing, the name of the environment if it has been set (name), the number of jobs in submitted (submitted), running (running), done (done) and failed (failed) state, a list of errors that happened since the last state query (errors) with the message (message), the stack (stackTrace) and the error level (level)."}
      )}
      When failed the other field is:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"error"}}: a JSON structure containing the message (message) and the stack (stackTrace)"}
      )}
    """},
    li{html"""
      ${b{"GET /job/:id/output"}} - returns the output of a mole execution as a string. It has the following parameters:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the mole execution"}
      )}
    """},
    li{html"""
      ${b{"GET /job/:id/workDirectory/:file"}} - download a file or a directory from the server. It returns the content of the file or a tar.gz archive if the file is a directory. It has the following parameters:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the mole execution"},
        li{html"${b{"path"}} - the path of the file to download"}
      )}
    """},
    li{html"""
      ${b{"PROPFIND /job/:id/workDirectory/:file"}} - get info of a file or a directory from the server. It has the following parameters:
          ${ul(
            li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the mole execution}"},
            li{html"${b{"path"}} - the path of the file to download"},
            li{html"${b{"last"}} - this parameter is optional - an integer to list only the last n files."}
          )}
          When successful, it returns a listing of the directory, that look like this:
          ${hl.plain("""{
  "entries" : [ {
    "name" : "Pi.oms",
    "size" : 909,
    "modified" : 1584980668517,
    "type" : "file"
  } ],
  "modified" : 1584980668517,
  "type" : "directory"
}""")}

          The fields contains the following info:
          ${ul(
            li{html"${b{"name"}} - the name of the file"},
            li{html"${b{"type"}} - the type of the file. It can be (directory or file)"},
            li{html"${b{"modified"}} - the date of the last modification of this file"},
            li{html"${b{"size"}} - mentioned only for the entry of type \"file\". It contains the size of the file."}
          )}
    """},
    li{html"""
      ${b{"DELETE /job/:id"}} - cancel and remove an execution from the server. It has the following parameters:
      ${ul(
        li{html"${b{"id"}} - the id of the mole execution"}
      )}
    """},
    li{html"${b{"GET /job/"}} - list execution ids on the server."}
)}

The API exposes the following routes to submit and manage the plugins:
${ul(
  li(html"""
    ${b{"GET /plugin/"}} - list all user plugins loaded in OpenMOLE
    It returns a list containing the name of the plugins an a boolean set to true if the plugin is properly loaded.
  """),
  li(html"""
    ${b{"POST /plugin"}} - load one or several plugins in OpenMOLE. It has the following parameter:
    ${ul(
      li{html"${b{"file"}} - an OpenMOLE plugin file. Repeat this parameter to submit several plugins at once. "}
    )}
    When some errors occurs while loading some plugins it return a list containing the name of the plugin an the error that occurred while loading this plugins.
  """),
  li(html"""
    ${b{"DELETE /plugin"}} - unload (and remove) one or several plugins in OpenMOLE. Depending plugin are unloaded as well. It has the following parameter:
    ${ul(
      li{html"${b{"name"}} - the name of an OpenMOLE plugin. Repeat this parameter to submit several plugins at once."}
    )}
    It return a list with the name of the plugins which have ben unloaded.
