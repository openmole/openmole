${h2{"The eX Modelo school"}}
Since 2019, the OpenMOLE team organizes a ${b{"summer school about model exploration"}} (sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation, ${i{"etc."}}).
The applied examples of the theoretical concepts taught during the school use the tools available on the OpenMOLE platform, making it a great opportunity to learn both about model exploration in general, and the use of the platform!

$br

For more information on the school, please visit the ${aa("eX Modelo website", href := shared.link.exmodelo)}.

${h2{"Short and free discovery trainings"}}

We are also open to come and present OpenMOLE at institutions or to teams who would like to use the platform.
To discuss about this possibility, please contact us via the ${aa("forum", href := shared.link.forum)} or the ${aa("chat", href := shared.link.chat)}.
