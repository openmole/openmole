TITLE AND HEADERS
No need to put a page title, it's done during the page creation step
Start directly with your page content
The content can be organized with headers
Allowed header levels are @h2, @h3, and @h6 (@h4 and @h5 levels are reserved for other uses)
All @h2 headers will automatically appear in a "Contents" section at the top of the page


SPACING
Spaces around headers are automatically created, no need to put additional spaces when creating a new section
To facilitate reading, manually add spaces around images (add @br@br before and @br after the image, except when the next element is a header) and code bits (add @br@br before and @br after the code bit).


FORMATTING
To create a new line use @br
To create a new paragraph use @br@br
Bold with @b{word}
Italic with @i{word}
Create an unordered list with @ul
                                @li{first item,}
                                @li{second item,}
                                @li{last item}
Create an ordered list with @ol
                              @li{first item,}
                              @li{second item,}
                              @li{last item}
Inline code with @code{some code}
Bit of code which will be checked by the compiler with @hl.openmole("""
                                                         A longer bit of code
                                                         On several lines if needed
                                                         Like an example for instance
                                                       """)
Bit of code which will NOT be checked by the compiler with @hl.openmoleNoTest("""
                                                             A longer bit of code
                                                             On several lines if needed

                                                           """)
Include an image with @img(src := path.to.the.image, center(100))
Include a link with @a("text to write", href := link.to.something)
