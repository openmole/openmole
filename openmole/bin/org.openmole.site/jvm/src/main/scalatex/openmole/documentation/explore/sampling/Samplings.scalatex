@h2{Design of Experiment}

Design of Experiment (DoE) is the art of setting up an experimentation.
In a model simulation context, it boils down to declaring the inputs under study (most of the time, they're parameters) and the values they will take, for a batch of several simulations, with the idea of revealing a property of the model (@i{e.g.} sensitivity).

@br

Your model inputs can be sampled in the traditional way, by using a @aa("grid (or regular) sampling", href:= elementarySamplings.file + "#GridSampling"), or by @aa("sampling uniformly", href:= uniformSampling.file) inside their respective domains.
For higher dimension input space, specific statistics techniques ensuring low discrepancy like @aa("Latin Hypercube Sampling", href := highDimensionSamplings.file + "#LatinHypercubeSampling") and @aa("SobolSequence", href := highDimensionSamplings.file + "#SobolSequence") are available.

@br

You can also use your own DoE in OpenMOLE, by providing a @a("CSV file", href := customSampling.file) containing your samples to OpenMOLE.



@h2{The DirectSampling constructor}
@a("check code source", href:="https://github.com/openmole/openmole/blob/14-dev/openmole/plugins/org.openmole.plugin.method.directsampling/src/main/scala/org/openmole/plugin/method/directsampling/package.scala#L158:L164")

In OpenMOLE, a DoE is set up through the @code{DirectSampling} constructor.
This constructor will generate a workflow, which is illustrated below.
You may recognize the @i{map reduce} design pattern, provided that an aggregation operator is defined (otherwise it would just be a @i{map} :-) )

@h3{Sampling over several inputs}

Samplings can be performed over several inputs domains as well as on @b{several input types}, using the @b{cartesian product} operator @b{x} as follow:

@br@br

@hl.openmole("""
val i = Val[Int]
val j = Val[Double]
val k = Val[String]
val l = Val[Long]
val m = Val[File]

val exploration =
  DirectSampling(
    evaluation = myModel,
    sampling =
      (i in (0 to 10 by 2)) x
      (j in (0.0 to 5.0 by 0.5)) x
      (k in List("Leonardo", "Donatello", "Raphaël", "Michelangelo")) x
      (l in (UniformDistribution[Long]() take 10)) x
      (m in (workDirectory / "dir").files().filter(f => f.getName.startsWith("exp") && f.getName.endsWith(".csv")))
  ) hook(workDirectory / "path/of/a/file.csv")
""", header = "val myModel = EmptyTask()", name = "several inputs")

@br

The @code{DirectSampling} task executes the model @b{myModel} for every possible combination of the 5 inputs provided in the @code{sampling} parameter.
The @code{hook} provided after the task will save the results of your sampling in a CSV file, see the @a("next section", href := "#Hook") for more details about this hook.

@br@br

The arguments of the @code{DirectSampling} task are the following:

@ul
    @li{@code{evaluation} is the task (or a composition of tasks) that uses your inputs, typically your model task,}
    @li{@code{sampling} is where you define your DoE, @i{i.e.} the inputs you want varied,}
    @li{@code{aggregation} (@i{optional}) is @a(href := aggregationSampling.file, "an aggregation operation") to be performed on the outputs of your evaluation task.}

The @code{l} parameter is a uniform sampling of 10 numbers of the Long type, taken in the [Long.MIN_VALUE; Long.MAX_VALUE] domain of the Long native type.
More details can be found @a("here", href := uniformSampling.file).

@br

The @code{m} parameter is a sampling over different files that have been uploaded to the @b{workDirectory}.
The files are explored as items of a list, gathered by the @code{files()} function and applied on the @code{dir} directory/
Optionally, this list of files can be filtered with any @code{String => Boolean} functions such as @code{contains(), startswith(), endswith()} (see the @aa("Java Class String Documentation", href:= shared.link.javaString) for more details.
More information on this sampling type @a("here", href := fileSampling.file).


@h3{Hook}

The @code{hook} keyword is used to save or display results generated during the execution of a workflow.
The generic way to use it is to write either @code{hook(workDirectory / "path/of/a/file.csv")} to save the results in a CSV file, or @code{hook display} to display the results in the standard output.

@br@br

There are some arguments specific to the @code{DirectSampling} task which can be added to the hook:

@ul
  @li{@code{output} is to choose what to do with the results as shown above, either a file path or the word @code{display},}
  @li{@code{values = Seq(i, j)} specifies which variables from the data flow should be saved or displayed, by default all variables from the dataflow are used,}
  @li{@code{header = "Col1, Col2, ColZ"} customises the header of the CSV file to be created with the string it receives as a parameter, please note that this only happens if the file doesn't exist when the hook is executed,}
  @li{@code{arrayOnRow = true} forces the flattening of input lists such that all list variables are written to a single row/line of the CSV file, it defaults to @code{false}.}

Here is a use example:

@br@br

@hl.openmole("""
val i = Val[Int]
val j = Val[Double]

val exploration =
  DirectSampling(
    evaluation = myModel,
    sampling =
      (i in (0 to 10 by 2)) x
      (j in (0.0 to 5.0 by 0.5))
  ) hook(
    output = display,
    values = Seq(i),
    format = CSVOutputFormat(arrayOnRow = true))
""", header = "val myModel = EmptyTask()", name = "hook direct sampling")

@br

@h2{Model replication}
@a("check code source", href:="https://github.com/openmole/openmole/blob/14-dev/openmole/plugins/org.openmole.plugin.method.directsampling/src/main/scala/org/openmole/plugin/method/directsampling/package.scala#L90:L98")

If your model is stochastic, you may want to define a replication task to run several replications of the model for the same parameter values.
This is similar to using a uniform distribution sampling on the seed of the model, and OpenMOLE provides a specific constructor for this, the @code{Replication} task.

@br

The @code{Replication} sampling is used as follow:

@br@br

@hl.openmole("""
val mySeed = Val[Int]
val i = Val[Int]
val o = Val[Double]

val myModel =
  ScalaTask("val rng = Random(mySeed); val o = i * 2 + 0.1 * rng.nextDouble()") set (
    inputs += (i, mySeed),
    outputs += (i, o)
  )

Replication(
  evaluation = myModel,
  seed = mySeed,
  sample = 100,
  aggregation = Seq(o aggregate median)
) hook display
""", name="example of replication")

@br

The arguments for @code{Replication} are the following:

@ul
  @li{@code{evaluation} is the task (or a composition of tasks) that uses your inputs, typically your model task and a hook.}
  @li{@code{seed} is the prototype for the seed, which will be sampled with an uniform distribution in its domain (it must ba a Val[Int] or a Val[Long]). This prototype will be provided as an input to the model.}
  @li{@code{sample} (Int) is the number of replications.}
  @li{@code{index} (@i{optional}, Val[Int]) is an optional variable Val that can provide you with a replication index for each replication.}
  @li{@code{distributionSeed} (@i{optional}, Long) is an optional seed to be given to he uniform distribution of the seed ("meta-seed"). Providing this value will fix the pseudo-random sequence generated for the prototype @code{seed}.}
  @li{@code{aggregation} (@i{optional}) is a list of aggregations to be performed on the outputs of your evaluation task.}


@h3{Hook}

The @code{hook} keyword is used to save or display results generated during the execution of a workflow.
The generic way to use it is to write either @code{hook(workDirectory / "path/of/a/file.csv")} to save the results in a CSV file, or @code{hook display} to display the results in the standard output.

@br@br

There are some arguments specific to the @code{Replication} task which can be added to the hook:

@ul
  @li{@code{output} is to choose what to do with the results as shown above, either a file path or the word @code{display},}
  @li{@code{values = Seq(i, j)} specifies which variables from the data flow should be saved or displayed, by default all variables from the dataflow are used,}
  @li{@code{header = "Col1, Col2, ColZ"} customises the header of the CSV file to be created with the string it receives as a parameter, please note that this only happens if the file doesn't exist when the hook is executed,}
  @li{@code{arrayOnRow = true} forces the flattening of input lists such that all list variables are written to a single row/line of the CSV file, it defaults to @code{false},}
  @li{@code{includeSeed} is a @code{Boolean} to specify whether you want the seed from the @code{Replication} task to be saved with the workflow variables, @code{false} by default.}

Here is a use example:f

@br@br

@hl.openmole("""
val mySeed = Val[Int]
val i = Val[Int]
val o = Val[Double]

val myModel =
  ScalaTask("import scala.util.Random; val rng = new Random(mySeed); val o = i * 2 + 0.1 * rng.nextDouble()") set (
    inputs += (i, mySeed),
    outputs += (i, o)
  )

Replication(
  evaluation = myModel,
  seed = mySeed,
  sample = 100
